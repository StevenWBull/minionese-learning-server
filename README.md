# Minionese Learning Server!
## Created by Brock Boutwell & Steven Bull 

### What is it?

The minionese learning app is a project created by Steven Bull and Brock Boutwell. The project centers around the learning of the coveted 'banana language' of the minions. The server uses a special algorithm in order to increase the retention and learning execution of users. If an answer in incorrect the word gets moved to the next word, however if it is correct, the word gets pushed back x amount of spaces. This ensures that before moving on to new and exciting lexicons, the words are commited to memory through repetition.
